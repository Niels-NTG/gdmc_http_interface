# GDMC-HTTP 1.6.0 (Minecraft 1.19.2 + 1.20.2 + 1.21.4)

- NEW: `GET /heightmap` endpoint no longer requires having to set a build area using the in-game `/setbuildarea` command. It now also accepts `x`, `z`, `dx` and `dz` parameters to specify any area.
- NEW: `GET /heightmap` endpoint also accepts a `withinBuildArea` flag to skip over positions outside the build area.
- NEW: `GET /heightmap` endpoint can now also match specific block states when using custom heightmaps. For example: `blocks=oak_log[axis=y]` will only include upright oak tree logs, while horizontal oak logs (`minecraft:oak_log[axis=x]` and `minecraft:oak_log[axis=z]`) are excluded.
- FIX: `GET /blocks` now returns `minecraft:void_air` instead of `minecraft:air` for positions outside the vertical world limit.
- FIX: `PUT /blocks` discard placement instructions outside vertical world limit.
- FIX: `GET /heightmap` fixed inconsistent responses when using custom block lists due to undefined behaviour during parsing of the `blocks` query parameter.
- FIX: `GET /heightmap` when using custom heightmaps, match blocks on all possible block states instead of only the default ones. For example: `blocks=oak_log` now matches `minecraft:oak_log[axis=x]` and `minecraft:oak_log[axis=z]` in addition to the default `minecraft:oak_log[axis=y]`.
- FIX: `GET /heightmap` values of `yBounds` parameter are now clamped to the vertical world limit.
- FIX: `GET /biomes` now returns an empty string for the biome ID if the requested position is outside vertical world limit.

# GDMC-HTTP 1.5.2 (Minecraft 1.19.2 + 1.20.2 + 1.21.4)

- FIX: Critical bug in custom heightmaps due to upper and lower Y bounds being reversed.
- FIX: Typos in documentation.

# GDMC-HTTP 1.5.1 (Minecraft 1.19.2 + 1.20.2 + 1.21.4)

- NEW: GDMC-HTTP is now compatible with Minecraft 1.21.4!
- FIX: Expanded and updated documentation.

# GDMC-HTTP 1.5.0 (Minecraft 1.19.2 + 1.20.2)

- NEW: GDMC-HTTP is now compatible with both the Forge and Fabric modding platform!
- NEW: `GET /heightmap` can now receive a list of [block IDs](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Java_Edition_data_values#Blocks), [block tag keys](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Tag#Block_tags_2) and [fluid tag keys](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Tag#Fluid_tags) to create your own custom heightmaps!
- NEW: `GET /heightmap` can now receive an upper and lower Y-value limit for the requested heightmap. Useful for taking measurements of the surface of caves or The Nether dimension.
- NEW: Add `keepLiquids` flag to `POST /structure` endpoint. When set to `false` it removes all water sources present at the placement locations of the to be placed structure.
- FIX: Actually implement behaviour to prevent spawning drops when placing structures for the `spawnDrops` flag of the `POST /structure` endpoint.
- FIX: `/commands` now returns a 405 is any other HTTP method besides `POST` is used.

# GDMC-HTTP 1.4.6 (Minecraft 1.19.2 + 1.20.2)

- NEW: To enhance backwards compatibility, all features introduced in GDMC-HTTP 1.4.0 are now also available for Minecraft 1.19.2!
- FIX: When the `doBlockUpdates=false` parameter is set on `PUT /blocks` discard placement instructions for duplicate block positions except the last one for that position. This prevents an undefined behaviour that made it impossible to predict in what order placement instructions targeting the same block position would resolve.

# GDMC-HTTP 1.4.5 (Minecraft 1.20.2)

- NEW: GDMC-HTTP can now also be obtained via the [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/gdmc-http-interface/) mod portal!
- FIX: Add proper error handling for some instances where NBT data for a sign block submitted via `PUT /blocks` was formatted incorrectly ([#26](https://github.com/Niels-NTG/gdmc_http_interface/issues/26)).
- FIX: Restore `spawnDrops` flag of `PUT /blocks` back to working order ([#27](https://github.com/Niels-NTG/gdmc_http_interface/issues/27)).
- FIX: `/item` command now works as expected when called via the `POST /commands` endpoint ([#28](https://github.com/Niels-NTG/gdmc_http_interface/issues/28)).

# GDMC-HTTP 1.4.4 (Minecraft 1.20.2)

- FIX: Allow `GET /chunks` to be used without having to set a build area.
- FIX: Off-by-one bugs for block/chunk ranges in request URLs.
- FIX: Documentation cleanup.

# GDMC-HTTP 1.4.3 (Minecraft 1.20.2)

- FIX: `OPTIONS /` now also returns the [`DataVersion`](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Data_version) field.
- FIX: Expanded and updated documentation.

# GDMC-HTTP 1.4.2 (Minecraft 1.20.2)

- FIX: `GET /biomes` do not return entries for positions beyond the world's build height range.
- FIX: Respond with `404` status when `GET /biomes` has the `withinBuildArea=true` flag while no build area has been set using the `/setbuildarea` command.
- FIX: Respond with `404` status when `GET /blocks` has the `withinBuildArea=true` flag while no build area has been set using the `/setbuildarea` command.

# GDMC-HTTP 1.4.1 (Minecraft 1.20.2)

# GDMC-HTTP 1.3.3 (Minecraft 1.19.2)

- NEW: Add logo designed by [Blinkenlights](https://github.com/Flashing-Blinkenlights).
- FIX: Improved documentation.
- FIX: Replace links to Minecraft wiki the new domain (https://minecraft.wiki/).

# GDMC-HTTP 1.3.2 (Minecraft 1.19.2)

- NEW: Add `GET /heightmap` to get heightmap data of a given [type](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Heightmap) of the currently set build area. Thanks to [cmoyates](https://github.com/cmoyates)!
- NEW: Add custom heightmap types `MOTION_BLOCKING_NO_PLANTS` and `OCEAN_FLOOR_NO_PLANTS`.
- NEW: Add `withinBuildArea` flag to `GET /blocks`. If set to true it skips over positions outside the build area.
- NEW: Add `withinBuildArea` flag to `PUT /blocks`. If set to true it does not place blocks outside the build area.

# GDMC-HTTP 1.2.3 (Minecraft 1.19.2)

- FIX: With `PUT /blocks`, allow for changing the block entity (NBT) data of a block even if the target block matches the block state and block ID of the placement instruction. This makes it possible to do things such as changing the text on an existing sign or changing the items of an already placed chest.
- FIX: Reworked the algorithm for changing the shape of a block to fit with directly adjacent blocks (e.g. fences) to be more efficient.

# GDMC-HTTP 1.2.2 (Minecraft 1.19.2)

- FIX: Ensure blocks placed via `POST /structure` always update on the client side to reflect its block entity data (e.g. text on signs, pieces of armor on armor stands, etc.). Prior to this fix the data was correctly parsed, but only became visible in-game if the relevant chunks were reloaded.
- FIX: Remove support for `pivotY` URL query parameter in the `POST /structure` endpoint since it wasn't implemented in the first place. Minecraft does not support it. This is not a breaking change since unknown query parameters will be ignored by GDMC-HTTP.
- FIX: Add clarification on the transformation order of structures in the `POST /structure` endpoint to documentation.

# GDMC-HTTP 1.2.1 (Minecraft 1.19.2)

- FIX: Issue where NBT file returned by `GET /structure` wasn't GZIP-compressed even if the `"Content-Encoding"` request header contained the word "gzip".
- FIX: Improve error handling when an empty file is submitted to `POST /structure`.

- NEW: Add `GET /players` endpoint to get all players on the server. Thanks to [cmoyates](https://github.com/cmoyates)!
- NEW: Add support for [target selector](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Target_selectors) for entities in the `GET /entities` endpoint using the `selector` query parameter.
- NEW: Add support for [target selector](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Target_selectors) for players in the `GET /players` endpoint using the `selector` query parameter.
- NEW: Unset build area by entering the `/setbuildarea` command without arguments.

# GDMC-HTTP 1.1.1 (Minecraft 1.19.2)

- FIX: Undo explicitly setting HTTP interface address to the "loop back" address.

# GDMC-HTTP 1.1.0 (Minecraft 1.19.2)

- NEW: `POST /command` now accepts `x`, `y`, `z` parameters, usefull for when using commands with [relative coordinates](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Coordinates#Relative_world_coordinates).
- NEW: Add `OPTIONS /` to get version of Minecraft and version of GDMC-HTTP interface.
- NEW: Port number of the HTTP interface can be changed using the `/sethttpport <port>` Minecraft console command. This value will be saved to a config file and therefore will be persistent.
- NEW: Get port number of the HTTP interface via the `/gethttpport` Minecraft console command.
- FIX: The `/setbuildarea` console command can now also accept coordinates that aren't loaded yet.
- FIX: Explicitly set HTTP interface address to that of the "loop back" address, which is usually "localhost".

# GDMC-HTTP 1.0.0 (Minecraft 1.19.2)

- NEW: First stable release!
- BREAKING: JSON-formatted NBT-like data is no longer supported in request bodies. Use [SNBT notation](https://minecraft.wiki/w/NBT_format#SNBT_format) instead.

- BREAKING: Plain-text formatted responses have been removed in favour of JSON.
- BREAKING: Consistent error messages.
- BREAKING: Plain-text request bodies are no longer accepted (except for `POST /command`). JSON-formatted request bodies are expected instead.
- FIX: Improved performance!

# GDMC-HTTP 0.7.6 (Minecraft 1.19.2)

- FIX: `GET /biomes` now returns an empty string for the biome ID if the requested position is outside the vertical boundaries of the world.
- FIX: Typo in error message `POST /structure` handler.

# GDMC-HTTP 0.7.5 (Minecraft 1.19.2)

- NEW: `GET /entities` for reading entities within a certain area.
- NEW: `PUT /entities` for creating any number of entities.
- NEW: `PATCH /entities` for editing existing entities in the world.
- NEW: `DELETE /entities` for removing existing entities from the world.
- NEW: Add parameters `doBlockUpdates`, `spawnDrops` and `customFlags` from the `PUT /blocks` endpoint to the `POST /structure` endpoint as well.
- FIX: Issue where output with the response header `Content-Encoding: gzip` didn't actually return gzipped response for the endpoints `GET /chunks` and `GET /structures`.
- FIX: Partial refactor for improved readability and decreased branching.

# GDMC-HTTP 0.7.4 (Minecraft 1.19.2)

- FIX: Placement of multipart blocks such as beds and doors.

# GDMC-HTTP 0.7.3 (Minecraft 1.19.2)

- NEW: Improved user-facing documentation.

# GDMC-HTTP 0.7.2 (Minecraft 1.19.2)

- FIX: Add proper exception handling for malformed JSON input at `PUT /blocks`.

# GDMC-HTTP 0.7.1 (Minecraft 1.19.2)

- FIX: Allow endpoint `PUT /blocks` to process block placement instructions without (valid) coordinates. It places it at the URL query coordinates instead.

# GDMC-HTTP 0.7.0 (Minecraft 1.19.2)

- NEW:`PUT /blocks` endpoint can now accept a JSON-formatted request body as input using the request header `"Content-Type": "application/json"`. The format is identical the response of the `GET /blocks` with the `"Accept": "application/json"` request header, with a few minor additional features:
  - For each placement instruction, `x`, `y` and `z` are optional. If omitted, it uses the coordinate set in the request's URL query as a fallback, or 0 if these aren't set.
  - For each placement instruction, `x`, `y` and `z` can be an integer ("x": `32`) or use tilde (`"x": "~32"`) or caret (`"x": "^32"`) notation in a string.
  - Block state (`"state"`) and block entity data (`"data"`) can be an JSON object, a single string or can be omitted all together.
  - When placing blocks with `PUT /blocks`, the "shapes" of directly adjacent blocks are updated, unless the `doBlockUpdates` flag is explicitly disabled. This means that placing a fence block
    directly adjacent to an existing block changes the shape of the fence
    such that it makes the appropriate connections.
- NEW:`POST /structure` can now accept both GZIP-compressed and uncompressed NBT files.
- NEW:`GET /structure` can now output GZIP-compressed (default) or uncompressed NBT files. The latter can be achieved by setting the request header `"Accept-Encoding": "*"`.
- BREAKING: JSON response format of `PUT /blocks` has changed to a simple array of strings.
- BREAKING: For `GET /chunks`, the binary format is now the default unless the `"Accept"` header is set to `"application/json"` or `"text/plain"`.
- BREAKING:`/version` now returns a 405 is any other HTTP method besides `GET` is used.
- FIX: Improvements to code readability.
- FIX: Minor improvements to performance.

- NEW: Add `GET /structure` endpoint, for generating an NBT-formatted file of an area of blocks in the world.
- NEW: Add `POST /structure` endpoint, for placing an NBT-formatted file of a structure into the world.

# GDMC-HTTP 0.6.4 (Minecraft 1.19.2)

- NEW: Enable `GET /chunks` to return a JSON-formatted response when the request header `Accept` is set to `application/json`.

- NEW: `GET /blocks` can return multiple blocks within a given area.
- NEW: Response of `GET /blocks` now always includes a block's position in front of its material.
- BREAKING: JSON response format of `GET /blocks` is now a JSON array instead of a single object.
- BREAKING: Response of `GET /blocks` now always includes a block's position in front of its material.
- BREAKING: Endpoint `OPTIONS /blocks` has been removed.
- BREAKING: Upgrade to Forge 1.19.2-43-2.0.
- FIX: Minor performance improvements.

# GDMC-HTTP 0.5.3 (Minecraft 1.19.2)

- NEW: Implement parameter for specify target dimension (overworld, nether, end, etc.) for the `/blocks`, `/command` and `/chunks` endpoints. For example `PUT /blocks?dimension=nether` places blocks in the nether instead of the overworld. If parameter is omitted it defaults to the overworld.
- NEW: Implement `OPTIONS` method for the `/blocks` endpoint.
- FIX: Relative position placement for blocks with a `~<int>` position when placing blocks with the `PUT /blocks` endpoint.

# GDMC-HTTP 0.5.2 (Minecraft 1.19.2)

- BREAKING: Renamed `GET /info` endpoint to `GET /version`.

# GDMC-HTTP 0.5.1 (Minecraft 1.19.2)
