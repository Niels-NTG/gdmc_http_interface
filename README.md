## What it's all about

This mod opens an HTTP interface so that other programs (on the same machine) can read and modify a Minecraft world. It is designed as a tool to be used for the [Generative Design in Minecraft Competition (GDMC)](http://gendesignmc.engineering.nyu.edu/).

When you open a Minecraft world, this mod opens an HTTP server on `localhost:9000`. I recommend using [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) or a similar application to test out the http interface. For building a structure generator I recommend using the [GDPC](https://github.com/avdstaaij/gdpc) Python library.

This repo is based on a fork of [Niki Gawlik's GDMC HTTP Interface](https://github.com/nilsgawlik/gdmc_http_interface) (Minecraft 1.16.5).
