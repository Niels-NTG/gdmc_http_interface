# GDMC HTTP Interface Mod

![logo](./src/main/resources/logo.png)

Forge Mod for Minecraft (Java Edition) that implements an HTTP interface for reading and writing blocks (and more).

With this interface you can use other applications and scripts running on the same machine to read and modify a Minecraft world.

This is designed as a tool for the [Generative Design in Minecraft Competition (GDMC)](http://gendesignmc.engineering.nyu.edu/), an annual competition for generative AI systems in Minecraft, where the challenge is to write an algorithm that creates a settlement while adapting to pre-existing terrain.

## Installation

1. You need to own a copy of [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/) Java Edition and have it installed on your machine.
2. Get the Forge Mod Installer and navigate to your version of Minecraft that is supported by this mod (1.20.2, 1.19.2 or 1.16.5). In the "Download Recommended" section click "Installer" to download. Open the downloaded file to install this version of Forge. Here are some troubleshooting resources If you have trouble opening this jar file:
    - [macOS](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252960079)
    - [Ubuntu and Ubuntu-based Linux distros](https://itsfoss.com/run-jar-file-ubuntu-linux/)
3. Download this mod's jar file from [here](https://github.com/Niels-NTG/gdmc_http_interface/releases/latest) and move it in the mod folder:
    - On Windows: `%APPDATA%/.minecraft/mods`.
    - On macOS: `~/Library/Application\ Support/Minecraft/mods`.
    - On Linux desktop: `~/.minecraft/mods`
4. Open the Minecraft launcher, go to the "Installations" tab and click "Play" on the Forge installation in the list.

## Usage

When you open a Minecraft world, you will see a chat message that the mod has opened an HTTP connection at the address `localhost:9000`. This means that you can now send HTTP requests from an external program to Minecraft while the world is open.

For testing and experimentation we recommend an API testing tool such as [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or a command line tool such as `cURL` or `wget`. When you want to build your own settlement generator or some other application, we recommend the [GDPC](https://github.com/avdstaaij/gdpc) Python library, which is purpose-built by the GDMC community to work with this mod. But any programming or scripting language that supports communication over HTTP (which includes most of them, be it either built-in or via an easy-to-use library) will work.

Information in the following sections are primarily applicable to GDMC-HTTP version 1.3.0 or later.

### HTTP Endpoints

When the HTTP interface is active, you have access to the following HTTP endpoints:

### Commands

This mod adds the following custom console commands to the game:

| Command                                                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/setbuildarea <fromX> <fromY> <fromZ> <toX> <toY> <toZ>` | Sets virtual "build area" to a certain area of the world. `GET` endpoints use this as their default area. Endpoints that edit the world can use the `withinBuildArea` flag to constrain actions to this area. For the command arguments you can mix and match absolute, [local](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Coordinates#Local_coordinates) or [relative](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Coordinates#Relative_world_coordinates) coordinates. |
| `/setbuildarea` (no arguments)                            | Unset build area                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `/sethttpport <number>`                                   | Changes port number of the HTTP interface. Useful for when the default port (`9000`) conflicts with some other application on your machine. You need to reload your world for this setting to take effect.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `/sethttpport` (no arguments)                             | Reset port number of the HTTP interface back to the default `9000`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `/gethttpport`                                            | Show current port number of the HTTP interface                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
